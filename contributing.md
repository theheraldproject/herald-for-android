# Contributing

The Herald project team welcomes contributions from the community. If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our developer certificate of origin (DCO), our bot will update the issue when you open a Pull Request. For any questions about the DCO process, please contact a project maintainer.

This page presents guidelines for contributing to this repository. Following the guidelines helps to make the contribution process easy, collaborative, and productive. 

## Inclusivity

The Herald Project strives to include people who may have anxiety about working in opensource
software and hardware or working in social teams. Some of our founders are neurodiverse. We
want to encourage maximum participation in the opensource community. Project members can provide
1:1 pairing or advice to any new contributor. In particular we can offer a supportive environment
to those who are ADD/ADHD or Autistic. Please contact us if you have always wanted to help in
opensource but haven't because of concerns of fitting in - we can help!

## Submitting Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Please submit bug reports and feature requests by using our GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/theheraldproject/herald-for-android/issues) page.

Before you submit a bug report about the code in the repository, please check the Issues page to see whether someone has already reported the problem. In the bug report, be as specific as possible about the error and the conditions under which it occurred. On what version and build did it occur? What are the steps to reproduce the bug? 

Feature requests should fall within the scope of the project.

## Pull Requests

The Herald project team use GitFlow to manage contributions, with feature-ISSUENUM
branches created off of the develop branch.

Please read a guide on GitFlow before you start work on an issue, and add a comment
to the issue you are working on so work is not duplicated.

Please also ensure that every commit is signed-off (in text, not GPG key signing) as follows in each commit message:-

`Signed-off-by: Joe Bloggs <myemail@somedomain.com>`

Note: The correct whitespace here is important.

Please also add yourself to the AUTHORS.md file so your contribution is publicly recognised.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure that your modifications work for a variety of scenarios and the demo app.
